            <h4>Liability for Contents</h4>
            <p>As service providers, we are liable for own contents of these websites according to Sec. 7, paragraph 1
                German Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to Sec. 8 to 10 German Telemedia Act (TMG), service providers
                are not obligated to permanently monitor submitted or stored information or to search for evidences that
                indicate illegal activities.</p>
            <p>Legal obligations to removing information or to blocking the use of information remain unchallenged. In this
                case, liability is only possible at the time of knowledge about a specific violation of law. Illegal
                contents will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.</p>

            <p>Our offer includes links to external third party websites. We have no influence on the contents of those

            <p>The linked websites had been checked for possible violations of law at the time of the establishment of the
                link. Illegal contents were not detected at the time of the linking. A permanent monitoring of the contents
                of linked websites cannot be imposed without reasonable indications that there has been a violation of law.
                Illegal links will be removed immediately at the time we get knowledge of them.</p>
