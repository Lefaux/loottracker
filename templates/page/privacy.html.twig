            <p>Comments are stored on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You have the right

                do is sent us an informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the
                lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>
            <p><strong>Request by e-mail, telephone or fax</strong></p>
            <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal
                data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your

                based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of a contract
                or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing
                is based on your consent (Article 6 (1) a GDPR) and/or on our legitimate interests (Article 6
                (1) (f) GDPR), since we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests
                addressed to us. The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you
                request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage
                lapses (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular

                tailored to you as well as on any of your devices (e.g. tablet or PC).</p>
            <p>If you have given us pertinent consent, Google will connect your web and app browser progressions

                personalized advertising messages on every device you log into with your Google account.</p>
            <p>To support this function, Google Analytics records Google authenticated IDs of users that are

                </h3></header>
            <p>Our website uses plug-ins of the YouTube platform, which is being operated by YouTube, LLC, 901
                Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.</p>
            <p>We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that
                YouTube does not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the
                video. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the sharing of data with YouTube
                partners can be ruled out as a result of the expanded data protection mode. For instance,
                regardless of whether you are watching a video, YouTube will always establish a connection with
                the Google DoubleClick network.</p>
            <p>As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on our website, a connection to YouTube’s servers
                will be established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you
                have visited. If you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable
                YouTube to directly allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have the
                option to prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to place various
                cookies on your device. With the assistance of these cookies, YouTube will be able to obtain
                information about our website visitor. Among other things, this information will be used to
                generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user friendliness of the site and to
                prevent attempts to commit fraud. These cookies will stay on your device until you delete
                them.</p>
            <p>Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be triggered after you
                have started to play a YouTube video, which are beyond our control.</p>
            <p>The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing
                manner. Pursuant to Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, this is a legitimate interest.</p>

            <p>We use “Google reCAPTCHA” (hereinafter referred to as “reCAPTCHA”) on our websites. The provider
                is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”).</p>
            <p>The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to determine whether data entered on our websites (e.g. information
                entered into a contact form) is being provided by a human user or by an automated program. To
                determine this, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the website visitors based on a variety of
                parameters. This analysis is triggered automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the
                site. For this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates a variety of data (e.g. IP address, time the
                website visitor spent on the site or cursor movements initiated by the user). The data tracked
                during such analyses are forwarded to Google.</p>
            <p>reCAPTCHA analyses run entirely in the background. Website visitors are not alerted that an
                analysis is underway.</p>
            <p>The data is processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. It is in the website operators
                legitimate interest, to protect the operator’s web content against misuse by automated
                industrial espionage systems and against SPAM.</p>

            <p>Gravatar is a service where users can log in and store profile images and their email
                addresses. If users with the respective email address on other online presences
                (especially in blogs) leave contributions or comments, so their profile pictures can be
                displayed next to the posts or comments. For this purpose, the email address provided by
                the users is sent to Gravatar to check whether a profile is stored to it. This is the
                only purpose of transmitting the email address and it is not used for other purposes but
                deleted thereafter.</p>
            <p>The use of Gravatar is based on our legitimate interests in the sense of art. <a

            <p>By displaying the images Gravatar brings the IP address of the users in experience, as

                Gravatar. Users can completely prevent the transfer of data by not using our internal
